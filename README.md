# Sayun Patient Information System

The Sayun Patient Information System is a web-based application that automates the different processes in a doctor’s clinic. Consistent with Sayun’s philosophy of making IT simple for end users, the goal of the project is to make a highly functional, easy-to-use patient information system.

## Stay Tuned!

We were currently developing the system as of the moment. We will be updating the repo every sprint.
